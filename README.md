##### ![15-minute chicken & halloumi burgers](https://github.com/skillscyprus/web_dev_exam/blob/main/imgs/meals/1.jpg?raw=true "RECIPE 1")

**Instructions**

1. Put the chicken breasts between two pieces of baking parchment and use a rolling pin to gently bash them until they are approximately 1cm thick.  
   Cut each chicken breast into two even pieces.  
2. If you're using a frying pan, heat two frying pans over medium-high heat, with one of them containing oil.  
   Fry the chicken in the oiled pan for 3-4 mins on each side until they are cooked through.  
   Season the chicken, reduce the heat, drizzle in the chilli sauce and half of the lemon juice, and cook for an additional 1-2 mins until the sauce is reduced.  
   Remove the chicken from the heat.  
3. If you're using an air-fryer, preheat it to 180C for 4 mins.  
   Add the chicken to the air-fryer and cook for 12 mins.  
   Drizzle over the chilli sauce and half the lemon juice and cook for an additional 1-2 mins until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is reduced.  
   Remove the chicken and keep it warm.  
4. While the chicken is cooking, toast the buns in the dry frying pan for 30 seconds.  
   Transfer them to a plate.  
   If you're using an air fryer, put the buns in the air fryer for 1-2 mins until they are warm.  
   Increase the air fryer temperature to 200C.  
   Add the halloumi to the air fryer basket and cook for 10 mins, turning halfway through, until it's golden.  
   Toss the cabbage with the mayo and the remaining lemon juice.  
5. Spoon the hummus (or dip of your choice) into the toasted buns, then top with the rocket, chilli chicken, halloumi, and peppers.  
   Drizzle with a little more chilli sauce, spoon over the cabbage, season with black pepper, and top with the bun lids.  
   Serve with any extra cabbage on the side or a green salad.

### RECIPE 5
#### **French Omelette**
##### ![French Omelette](https://github.com/skillscyprus/web_dev_exam/blob/main/imgs/meals/5.jpg?raw=true "RECIPE 5")

**Instructions**

1. Get everything ready.  
2. Warm a 20cm (measured across the top) non-stick frying pan on a medium heat.  
3. Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them with a fork so they break up and mix, but not as completely as you would for scrambled egg.  
4. With the heat on medium-hot, drop one knob of butter into the pan.  
5. It should bubble and sizzle, but not brown.  
6. Season the eggs with the Parmesan and a little salt and pepper, and pour into the pan.  
7. Let the eggs bubble slightly for a couple of seconds, then take a wooden fork or spatula and gently draw the mixture in from the sides of the pan a few times, so it gathers in folds in the centre.  
8. Leave for a few seconds, then stir again to lightly combine uncooked egg with cooked.  
9. Leave briefly again, and when partly cooked, stir a bit faster, stopping while there’s some barely cooked egg left.  
10. With the pan flat on the heat, shake it back and forth a few times to settle the mixture.  
11. It should slide easily in the pan and look soft and moist on top.  
12. A quick burst of heat will brown the underside.  
13. Grip the handle underneath.  
14. Tilt the pan down away from you and let the omelette fall to the edge.  
15. Fold the side nearest to you over by a third with your fork, and keep it rolling over, so the omelette tips onto a plate – or fold it in half, if that’s easier.  
16. For a neat finish, cover the omelette with a piece of kitchen paper and plump it up a bit with your fingers.  
17. Rub the other knob of butter over to glaze.  
18. Serve immediately.

**Instructions**

1. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6\.

3. Add the onion and leave to cook for 5 mins, stirring occasionally.  
4. Add the mushrooms to the saucepan with the onions.

6. If you are using a stock cube, crumble the cube into the roux now and stir well.  
7. Put the roux over a low heat and stir continuously for 2 mins – this will cook the flour and stop the sauce from having a floury taste.

14. Grease a medium-size ovenproof pie dish with a little butter and pour in the chicken and mushroom filling.  
15. Carefully lay the potatoes on top of the hot-pot filling, overlapping them slightly, almost like a pie top.  
16. Brush the potatoes with a little melted butter and cook in the oven for about 35 mins.

### RECIPE 12
#### **Osso Buco alla Milanese**
##### ![Osso Buco alla Milanese](https://github.com/skillscyprus/web_dev_exam/blob/main/imgs/meals/2.jpg?raw=true "RECIPE 12")

**Instructions**

1. Heat the oven to 300 degrees.  
2. Dredging the shanks: pour the flour into a shallow dish (a pie plate works nicely).  
3. Season the veal shanks on all sides with salt and pepper.  
4. One at a time, roll the shanks around in the flour coat, and shake and pat the shank to remove any excuses flour.  
5. Discard the remaining flour.  
6. Browning the shanks: put the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a wide Dutch oven or heavy braising pot (6 to 7 quart) and heat over medium-high heat.  
7. When the butter has melted and the oil is shimmering, lower the shanks into the pot, flat side down; if the shanks won’t fit without touching one another, do this in batches.  
8. Brown the shanks, turning once with tongs, until both flat sides are well caramelized, about 5 minutes per side.  
9. If the butter-oil mixture starts to burn, lower the heat just a bit.  
10. Transfer the shanks to a large platter or tray and set aside.  
11. The aromatics: pour off and discard the fat from the pot.  
12. Wipe out any burnt bits with a damp paper towel, being careful not to remove any delicious little caramelized bits.  
13. Ad the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pot and melt it over medium heat.  
14. When the butter has stopped foaming, add the onion, carrot, celery, and fennel.  
15. Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook the vegetables until they begin to soften but do not brown, about 6 minutes.  
16. Stir in the garlic, orange zest, marjoram, and bay leaf, and stew for another minute or two.  
17. The braising liquid: add the wine, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil.  
18. Boil, stirring occasionally, to reduce the wine by about half, 5 minutes.  
19. Add the stock and tomatoes, with their juice, and boil again to reduce the liquid to about 1 cup total, about 10 minutes.  
20. The braise: Place the shanks in the pot so that they are sitting with the exposed bone facing up, and pour over any juices that accumulated as they sat.  
21. Cover with parchment paper, pressing down so the parchment nearly touches the veal and the edges hang over the sides of the pot by about an inch.  
22. Cover tightly with the lid, and slide into the lower part of the oven to braise at a gentle simmer.  
23. Check the pot after the first 15 minutes, and if the liquid is simmering too aggressively, lower the oven heat by 10 or 15 degrees.  
24. Continue braising, turning the shanks and spooning some pan juices over the top after the first 40 minutes, until the meat is completely tender and pulling away from the bone, about 2 hours.  
25. The gremolata: While the shanks are braising, stir together the garlic, parsley, and lemon zest in a small bowl.  
26. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place (or the refrigerator, if your kitchen is very warm.  
27. ) The finish: When the veal is fork-tender and falling away from the bone, remove the lid and sprinkle over half of the gremolata.  
28. Return the veal to the oven, uncovered, for another 15 minutes to caramelize it some.  
29. Using a slotted spatula or spoon, carefully lift the shanks from the braising liquid, doing your best to keep them intact.  
30. The shanks will be very tender and threatening to fall into pieces, and the marrow will be wobbly inside the bones, so this can be a bit tricky.  
31. But if they do break apart, don’t worry, the flavor won’t suffer at all.  
32. Arrange the shanks on a serving platter or other large plate, without stacking, and cover with foil to keep warm.  
33. Finishing the sauce: Set the braising pot on top of the stove and evaluate the sauce: if there is a visible layer of fat floating on the surface, use a large spoon to skim it off and discard it.  
34. Taste the sauce for concentration of flavor.  
35. If it tastes a bit weak or flat, bring it to a boil over high heat, and boil to reduce the volume and intensify the flavor for 5 to 10 minutes.  
36. Taste again for salt and pepper.  
37. If the sauce wants more zip, stir in a teaspoon or two of the remaining gremolata.  
38. Portioning the veal shanks: if the shanks are reasonably sized, serve one per person.  
39. If the shanks are gargantuan or you’re dealing with modest appetites, pull apart the larger shanks, separating them at their natural seams, and serve smaller amounts.  
40. Be sure to give the marrow bones to whomever prizes them most.  
41. Serving: Arrange the veal shanks on warm dinner plates accompanied by the risotto, if serving.  
42. Just before carrying the plates to the table, sprinkle on the remaining gremolata and then spoon over a generous amount of sauce – the contact with the hot liquid will aromatize the gremolata and perk up everyone’s appetite with the whiff of garlic and lemon.

### RECIPE 17
#### **Spaghetti alla Carbonara**
##### ![Spaghetti alla Carbonara](https://github.com/skillscyprus/web_dev_exam/blob/main/imgs/meals/7.jpg?raw=true "RECIPE 17")

**Instructions**

1. Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.  
2. Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind.  
   Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.  
3. Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper.  
   Set everything aside.  
4. Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).  
5. Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.  
6. While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic.  
   Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.  
7. Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp.  
   The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.  
8. Keep the heat under the pancetta on low.  
   When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta.  
   Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.  
9. Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.  
10. Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat.  
    Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese.  
    Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.  
11. Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it).  
    You don’t want it wet, just moist.  
    Season with a little salt, if needed.  
12. Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl.  
    Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper.  
    If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.

### RECIPE 18
#### **Sushi**
##### ![Sushi](https://github.com/skillscyprus/web_dev_exam/blob/main/imgs/meals/8.jpg?raw=true "RECIPE 18")

**Instructions**

TO MAKE SUSHI ROLLS:

1. Pat out some rice.  
   Lay a nori sheet on the mat, shiny-side down.  
   Dip your hands in the vinegared water, then pat handfuls of rice on top in a 1cm thick layer, leaving the furthest edge from you clear.  
2. Spread over some Japanese mayonnaise.  
   Use a spoon to spread out a thin layer of mayonnaise down the middle of the rice.  
3. Add the filling.  
   Get your child to top the mayonnaise with a line of their favourite fillings – here we’ve used tuna and cucumber.  
4. Roll it up.  
   Lift the edge of the mat over the rice, applying a little pressure to keep everything in a tight roll.  
5. Stick down the sides like a stamp.  
   When you get to the edge without any rice, brush with a little water and continue to roll into a tight roll.  
6. Wrap in cling film.  
   Remove the mat and roll tightly in cling film before a grown-up cuts the sushi into thick slices, then unravel the cling film.

TO MAKE PRESSED SUSHI:

7. Layer over some smoked salmon.  
   Line a loaf tin with cling film, then place a thin layer of smoked salmon inside on top of the cling film.  
8. Cover with rice and press down.  
   Press about 3cm of rice over the fish, fold the cling film over and press down as much as you can, using another tin if you have one.  
9. Tip it out like a sandcastle.  
   Turn block of sushi onto a chopping board.  
   Get a grown-up to cut into fingers, then remove the cling film.

TO MAKE SUSHI BALLS:

10. Choose your topping.  
    Get a small square of cling film and place a topping, like half a prawn or a small piece of smoked salmon, on it.  
    Use damp hands to roll walnut-sized balls of rice and place on the topping.  
11. Make into tight balls.  
    Bring the corners of the cling film together and tighten into balls by twisting it up, then unwrap and serve.

### RECIPE 20
#### **Chicken Enchilada Casserole**
##### ![Chicken Enchilada Casserole](https://github.com/skillscyprus/web_dev_exam/blob/main/imgs/meals/20.jpg?raw=true "RECIPE 20")

**Instructions**

1. Cut each chicken breast in about 3 pieces, so that it cooks faster and put it in a small pot.  
2. Pour Enchilada sauce over it and cook covered on low to medium heat until chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.  
3. No water is needed, the chicken will cook in the Enchilada sauce.  
4. Make sure you stir occasionally so that it doesn't stick to the bottom.  
5. Remove chicken from the pot and shred with two forks.  
6. Preheat oven to 375 F degrees.  
7. Start layering the casserole.  
8. Start with about ¼ cup of the leftover Enchilada sauce over the bottom of a baking dish.  
9. I used a longer baking dish, so that I can put 2 corn tortillas across.  
10. Place 2 tortillas on the bottom, top with ⅓ of the chicken and ⅓ of the remaining sauce.  
11. Sprinkle with ⅓ of the cheese and repeat starting with 2 more tortillas, then chicken, sauce, cheese.  
12. Repeat with last layer with the remaining ingredients, tortillas, chicken, sauce and cheese.  
13. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes uncovered, until bubbly and cheese has melted and started to brown on top.  
14. Serve warm.
